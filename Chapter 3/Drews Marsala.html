            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>

            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make chiken 1/4 to 1/2 inches thick. To do this you might have to butterfly the chicken or pound it out.</li>
            <li>Cut shitake mushrooms in strips.</li>
            <li>Smash and peel three cloves of garlic, no need to chop them.</li>
            <li>Put 2-4 tbsps of butter in a pan. Allow butter to melt.</li>
            <li>Once the butter starts to bubble add 3-5 fresh sprigs of thyme. Cook for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms and garlic to the pan. Add salt and pepper to your liking. Cook until the mushrooms are nice and sauteed.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken breasts in flour.</li>
            <li>In another pan, add some olive oil over medium/high heat. Cook chicken for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Just before the chicken starts to brown add 1 cup of Marsala Wine.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook until it starts to reduce, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms, garlic and thyme to the pan with the chicken.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup of heavy cream. Mix it all up and let it cook until it thickens. I usually take a spoon and dip it in the sauce, then when it sticks to the back of the spoon it is my liking of thickness.</li>
            <li>Plate the chicken and top with the mushrooms. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Disguard the thyme and garlic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Send Drew a selfie of you enjoying your marsala.</li>
